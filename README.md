# AIRQUALITYMONITOR
An air quality monitoring application which makes it possible for everyone to check the air quality in their cities.
To run the project, run `npm run start`. This runs the server and client concurrently.
To build the project using Docker, change directory into client then run `docker-compose build airquality-service`.
Alternatively, from your project directory(client), run `docker-compose up` to build the app with the updated Compose file, and run it.


# Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
