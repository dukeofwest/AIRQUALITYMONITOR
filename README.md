# AIRQUALITYMONITOR
An air quality monitoring application which makes it possible for everyone to check the air quality in their cities.
To run the project, run `npm run start`. This runs the server and client concurrently.
To build the project using Docker, change directory into client then run `docker-compose build airquality-service`.
Alternatively, from your project directory(client), run `docker-compose up` to build the app with the updated Compose file, and run it.

* The App component is a container using Router. It gets user token & user information from our browserâ€™s Local Storage via auth.service. Then the navbar links for countries and details can then be displayed based on the user login state.
* Login component have a form for submission of data (with support of Form Validation). It uses the auth.service for sending login requests.
* auth.service uses Angular HttpClient ($http service) to make authentication requests.
* Countries and Details components will be displayed depending on login state from Local Storage. We use the countries.service to get protected resources from API.

* The Models is a container that contains the country json object and user object.
* The Routes container contains the api from which we connect to our db, as well as send our post request for login and get requests for countries and details properties.
* Our server uses express to serve our backend app on port 3000
